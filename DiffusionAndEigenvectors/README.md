After performing the gene scoring (code provided in mapregionpairsnp), we next performed node and edge diffusion on the graph. 

1. Node diffusion: We did node diffusion using a regularized laplacian kernel (see readme in reg_laplacian).
2. Edge diffusion: 
3. After edge diffusion, we extracted the subnetwork and performed qnormalization (with the qnorm_union.m script)
